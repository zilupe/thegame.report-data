56157,,29,,29,5,"Unknown. Islington Devils had lost to Euston Rockets convincingly in the regular season, but then beat them the week before also convincingly. Maybe that previous week's score was wrong?",
55922,,42,,29,4,"Educated guess. E=MC SWISH were pretty good that season and only lost to Supernova.",
55921,,42,,29,3,"Correct winner (Supernova). Supernova did win that championship.",
79979,,29,,42,3,"Correct winner (Rockets). Los Angels appear next week in the 3rd place final so they must have lost the semifinal.",
79981,,29,,42,4,"Educated guess. Markit were losing all games their first couple of seasons.",
79983,,42,,29,4,"Educated guess. The last game with the original Los Angels lineup, I think our first three seasons went 1st, 2nd, 4th, but not sure!",
79982,,42,,29,3,"Correct winner (E=MC SWISH). E=MC SWISH second title out of three consecutive ones.",
101712,5425,23,4949,32,4,"Wild guess. GM website lists the game as Burritos vs Burritos 23-32. It was probably Markit vs Burritos (as Markit had beaten Ocelots in the 5th place semi-final) and I'm guessing that Burritos won as they had beaten Markit 35-23 earlier in the season.",
113863,,31,,36,2,"Correct winner (Rockets) and probably the score too. Found on WhatsApp team chat, written by Eddie: 'After half it was 4:22 (yes 4) but at the end 31:36. Or close to that. We definitely lost by 5pts.'",
